To illustrate this, we consider a practical and relevant example for the event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm we want to write: two confined non-interacting particles in one space dimension. \n","\n","We consider a one-dimensional system with two particles of radius $R = 0.5$. These particles perform ellastic collisions with the hard walls at $x = 1$ and $x = 5$. They do **not** interact with each other. Below you find an animation in constant time steps and the corresponding **event-to-event images**.\n","\n","<figure class=\"image\">\n","  <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1zPtMjMdzw2G3B71Uts3V-ys2QrG-Ep13' alt=\"{{ include.description }}\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n","  <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dAi460XApx9sXQRcoXlxUJShkJWyucU2' alt=\"{{ include.description }}\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n","  <figcaption>\n","\n","Below you find a LAZY code, to be precise a **LAZY function find_nextEvent()**. The function contains unecessary steps, which you will quickly identify if you **think like a physicists**. Naively one should expect that the code reproduces the animation in the right pannel, i.e. it is not a simulation in constant time steps, but evolves the particle positions from event to event. Just like in the animations you see above, we loop over exactly 4 events. We plot the inital configuration and we plot the final configuration after the $4^{\\rm th}$ collision. We see: **something is wrong!!** One of the particles escaped the simulation box.\n","\n","**Your task:** Understand why the particle can escape the simulation box and fix the problem by removing the redundent computational steps in the function find_nextEvent(). The problem is in the function! To identify the problem, you can place print statements in the remaining code, but you are **NOT** allowed to make algorithmic changes outside the function.  \n","\n","To solve the problem, you may find the numpy function [np.where](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html) useful. If you scroll a bit lower, you will find alternative useful numpy hacks.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":279},"id":"ZD5vny0wQYXc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1628758236259,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":526,"user":{"displayName":"Juliane
