    "# **Understanding EVENT-DRIVEN molecular dynamics simulation on a simple toy model**\n",

    "The ultimate goal is to write an event-driven molecular dynamics simulation for a two-dimensional hard sphere system in a rectangular simulation box with hard walls. We can also say in simple words, we want to simulate a billiard system without friction and purely ellasitc collisions, i.e. the kinetic energy $E_{\\rm kin} = \\sum_i \\frac{m_i}{2} |\\vec{v_i}|^2$ and the momentum $p = \\sum_i m_i \\vec{v_i}$ are conserved.  See below two illustrations of our goal.  \n",

    "The toy model consits of a self-driving car on an empty high way. The car drives with constant speed $v_{\\rm car}$ and the speed corresponds exactly to the one indicated by the speed-limit signs on the high way. Furthermore, the car keeps track of its own position $x_{\\rm car}$. For simplicity, we consider only $v_{\\rm car}>0$.  \n",

    "3.   With the two new information $v_{\\rm car}$, $x_{\\rm speed}$, and the current position $x_{\\rm car}$, the car computes the remaining time $\\Delta t_{\\rm event}$ until the next \"event\" of passing a speed limit sign.\n",

    "1.   Evolve the trajectory until the time of the next event: $x_{\\rm car}(t+ \\Delta t_{\\rm event}) =  x_{\\rm car}(t) + v_{\\rm car} * \\Delta t_{\\rm event}$ .  \n",

    "3.   Get the information about the position of the next speed limit sign $x_{\\rm speed}$ and calculate the remaining time until the next event: $\\Delta t_{\\rm event}$.\n",
    "4. Go back to point 1\n",

    "\n",

    "However,  we ignore all the positions of the car inbetween two speed limit sings. Is that correct ? Maybe we could miss something ? The loop above simulates the car positions from *event to event*, i.e. from *speed sign to speed sign*. This is the key assumption here: nothing happens between two events that we cannot predict given what we know. \n",

For more complex systems than our toy model, one could ask the question if there is a critical density, above which the cars produce traffic jams, etc.  \n",

There will **always** be a time difference between two events (even if this difference might be very small). **This is an essential assumption for the algorithm we consider in this course.**  \n",

    "# Runtime and stability:\n",
    " In general, it is **NEVER advisable to be lazy** and let the computer do more work than necessary, just because we don't want to spend 15min to carefully **CONNECT the MATH in our algorithm to the PHYSICS of the system we want to simulate**. There are at least two very good reasons for that:\n",
    "1.   **Runtime**: Writing an algorithm with unecessary computational steps obviously means that we loose in performance. Note that there is an essential differences in creating **intermediate variables**, which make our code **readable** (we always want a readable code) and letting the computer do **redundant calculations** because we failed to understand the theory behind the algorithm.  \n",
    "Consider a **redundant calculation**, which takes $t_{CPU} = 3ms$ to compute. If this **redundant calculation** appears in a loop, this semingly negligable time loss may end up to a considerable number. This does not only mean that we waist our time (and the one of everyone who depends on our algorithm, e.g. collaborators, superior, customers, ...), but this also means that **we waist energy** (consider you contribute to a project that is in daily use, or runs in parallel on hundreds of CPUs $\\rightarrow$ poor climate). \n",
    "2.   **Stability**: Less obvious than the loss in efficiency, but even **more important** is the loss in stability of your algorithm. To illustrate this, we consider a practical and relevant example for the event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm we want to write: two confined non-interacting particles in one space dimension. \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a one-dimensional system with two particles of radius $R = 0.5$. These particles perform ellastic collisions with the hard walls at $x = 1$ and $x = 5$. They do **not** interact with each other. Below you find an animation in constant time steps and the corresponding **event-to-event images**.\n",

    "Below you find a LAZY code, to be precise a **LAZY function find_nextEvent()**. The function contains unecessary steps, which you will quickly identify if you **think like a physicists**. Naively one should expect that the code reproduces the animation in the right pannel, i.e. it is not a simulation in constant time steps, but evolves the particle positions from event to event. Just like in the animations you see above, we loop over exactly 4 events. We plot the inital configuration and we plot the final configuration after the $4^{\\rm th}$ collision. We see: **something is wrong!!** One of the particles escaped the simulation box.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:** Understand why the particle can escape the simulation box and fix the problem by removing the redundent computational steps in the function find_nextEvent(). The problem is in the function! To identify the problem, you can place print statements in the remaining code, but you are **NOT** allowed to make algorithmic changes outside the function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, you may find the numpy function [np.where](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html) useful. If you scroll a bit lower, you will find alternative useful numpy hacks.\n",

    "Consider the minimal example that you just fixed. You were working with a 1D array of positions and velocities. With numpy it was straightforward to calculate all collision times in one step and store them in a list.  \n",
    "With numpy, it is equally straightforward to generalize this procedure to two dimensions, where our data structure looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pos = [ [x_0, y_0],   [x_1, y_1],   [x_2, y_2]]\n",

    "```\n",
    "Imagine, we identify dtx_1 as the smallest $\\Delta t_{\\rm event}$.  \n",
    "We see that dtx_1 has the index dt_List[ **i = 1** ][ **j = 0** ].  \n",
    "Because the data structure of the dt_List is the same as in pos and vel, the **index of dtx_1 identifies the monomer index $i = 1$ and the wall direction $j = 0$**, i.e. the two information we need to update the velocity after a wall collision.  \n",
    "Therefore, the taks is **not** to find the smallest time but the task is to **find the index** of the smallest time in dt_List. (Reminder: you have already done it in 1D in the minimal example above!)  \n",
